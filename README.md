**This repository contains the Python code and analysis conducted for my thesis, focusing on football performance trends and prediction analysis. The study spans from 2013 to 2021, with a particular emphasis on understanding how home teams' performance varied before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.**

**Objectives**

1. Performance Analysis: Evaluate how the absence of crowds during the pandemic impacted home team performances compared to pre- and post-COVID periods.
2. Prediction Analysis: Utilize statistical and machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes based on historical data and observed trends.
   
**Features**

1. Data Processing: Cleaned and prepared football match datasets from 2013-2021.
2. Performance Metrics: Developed key metrics to compare home team performances across different periods.
3. Prediction Models: Built and evaluated prediction models to estimate match outcomes using pre-pandemic and pandemic-era data.
4. Visualization: Created plots to illustrate trends and results for better interpretability.
   
**Key Findings**

1. Home advantage was significantly impacted during the pandemic due to the absence of fans.
2. Predictive models showed varying accuracy when trained on data from different time periods, highlighting the uniqueness of the pandemic period.
